# Graph Coloring Analysis Project

#### This project was done for CS7350 - Algorithm Engineering

## Project Summary
* Implement Graph generation algorithms for: 
    * Complete Graphs
    * Cycle Graphs
    * Random Graphs
* The Random Graphs can have three edge distributions:
    * Uniform
    * Skewed linearly to lower values
    * Custom (Skewed linearly to higher values)
* Implement six vertex ordering algorithms:
    * Smallest Last Vertex
    * Largest Last Vertex
    * Smallest Original Degree Last
    * Largest Original Degree Last
    * Random
    * Depth - First Search
* Implement a graph coloring algorithm that colors based on the ordering from the six algorithms
* Analyze the runtime complexity of all algorithms
* Analyze the efficiency of coloring the graphs
